:::tip Hey!
If you've encountered the cropper on the Web that can't be implemented with this library, feel free to [write me](mailto:norserium@gmail.com) about it.

:::info How to use it?
This example is available as the standalone library [`react-mobile-cropper`](https://github.com/advanced-cropper/react-mobile-cropper). Feel free to use this library
in your projects instead of this library. It's based on this one and has almost identical API.
